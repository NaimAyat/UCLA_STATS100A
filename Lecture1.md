## Pre-Lecture Questions
* Playing with two six-sided dice. Interested in the sum. Which is more favorable; betting on 7 or 8?
  * Answer: 7, there are more combinations that add to 7. (1,6); (2,5); (3,4); (2,6); (3,5); (4,4). Note orders of dice can be switched, apart from (4,4). Hence, 7 shows up more.
* Same as above, this time 3 dice. Bet on 10 or 9? Answer: 10. The permutation (3,3,3) means that there are less permutations that add to 9.
